Hi Internet!

I'm just learning git and refreshing my python.
I'll be using this first little repo to solve Project Euler challenges before I move on to revamping my Android app!



Thanks for checking it out! :D

As [you can see](http://projecteuler.net/progress=Awesumness), I've actually completed a lot more than just the problems in this repo! ;B
